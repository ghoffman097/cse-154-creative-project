# cse-154-creative-project
This is a ongoing creative project I am working as a part of my web development class. I started with mostly cosmetic features and will add more funtionality 
as the class continues. My goal is to replicate some basic features of the windows 95 operating system. Currently, double clicing each icon opens a different
"window" which can be closed by double clicking again. The Internet icon opens an earlier version of this project.
